        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I'm an independent web developer.</p>
        <p>I enjoy design-driven projects and working with clients who value the visual impact of their site as much as its functionality.</p>
        <p>While I am most at home working in the front end (HTML, CSS, JS) I also do some backend work (Rails, WordPress).<p>Currently, I'm studying with Treehouse as a means to improve my workflow and gain industry standard practices. I've found that self-learning is immensely valuable, however it is also essential to be aligned with current practices as well.</p>
        <p>For me, development is about problem solving &amp; creativity and therefore is immensely satisfying.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am based in Bangkok and work remotely with clients.</p>
        <p>Before moving into web design and development I worked as a teacher for ten years. I was lucky to have spent most of my teaching career in South East Asia in some of the most dynamic and exciting cities in the world. This experience has deeply impacted my outlook on life.</p>
        <p>I'm a firm believer that the job of learning is never finished and that the best people are works in progress.</p>

        <h2>Professional Goals</h2>
        <p>I'm always looking for ways to improve my development and my design skills including:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>WordPress</li>
          <li>Sketch</li>
          <li>Bootstrap</li>
          <li>Skeleton</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ideally, I would like to be working remote with an agency earning a large sum of cash each month. However, I would suffice for a good entry-level position, working with nice people in a company that allows for a person to learn and grow.</p>
        <p>Besides building a career, I am working towards building up an informal community of aspiring developers and entrepneurs in Bangkok via Bangkok TechMeetups.<p>The aim of these meetups is to stimulate and maintain a supportive dialogue and build bridges in the Bangkok tech community.</p>
